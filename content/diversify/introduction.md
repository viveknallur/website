[Diversify](http://diversify-project.eu/) is an EU FP7 project, that aims at 
leveraging diversity, to improve software systems. <!--more--> An inter-disciplinary 
effort, one of our partners is the ECOBIO[^1] group
 from the [Université de Rennes 1](http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english/). The 
intent is that knowledge, concepts, and techniques flow in a two-way stream, 
between ecology and computer science. The full list of partners is as follows:

* [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes)
* [SINTEF](http://www.sintef.no/home/)
* [TCD] (http://www.tcd.ie/)
* [Université de Rennes 1](http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english/)

TCD works, along with INRIA and SINTEF, to automatically insert diversity into software. There are several levels at which a software system can be characterized:

* Source code level
* Algorithmic level
* Architectural level
* Ecosystem level (one piece of software in relation to others)

At each of these levels, our perspectives and concerns are different, and so are the basic units that can be manipulated.

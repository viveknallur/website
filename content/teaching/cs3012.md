information.

#### Announcements

<p> We seem to be having problems with Gitlab (developers are not granted 
```push``` access to the master branch, by default). You can get around this 
with the following set of commands:

```
your-cs3012_username-directory> git checkout -b assignments
your-cs3012_username-directory> mkdir 1
your-cs3012_username-directory> cd 1
your-cs3012_username-directory> git add yourfile.java
your-cs3012_username-directory> git add EngineersLog.csv
your-cs3012_username-directory> git commit -a -m "submission for assignment 1"
your-cs3012_username-directory> git push origin assignments
```

Basically, the first command creates a new branch called "assignments" and switches to it. Then you can add or commit as many files as you want. Just remember to push to "assignments" and not "master".

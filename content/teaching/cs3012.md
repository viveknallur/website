#### Gitlab

<hr/>

<p> We seem to be having problems with Gitlab (developers are not granted 
```push``` access to the master branch, by default). You can get around this 
with the following set of commands:

```
your-directory> git clone http://gitlab.scss.tcd.ie/vivek.nallur/cs3012_<yourusername>.git
your-director> cd cs3012_<yourusername>/
your-cs3012_username-directory> git checkout -b assignments
your-cs3012_username-directory> mkdir 2
your-cs3012_username-directory> cd 2
your-cs3012_username-directory> git add yourfile.java
your-cs3012_username-directory> git add EngineersLog.csv
your-cs3012_username-directory> git commit -a -m "submission for assignment 2"
your-cs3012_username-directory> git push origin assignments
```

Remember to push to the 'assignments' branch and not 'master'.

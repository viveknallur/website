#### Android App for Inventory Tracking

<hr/>

Groups and teams often invest in equipment for a specific project. This 
equipment usually has a barcode that is used to uniquely identify it. Equipment 
is allocated to an individual or a team, for a specified period. After this 
period is over, the equipment must be reclaimed from the individual/group.  

The app must be able to:

a) Add equipment by scanning the barcode
b) Add/Remove individuals
c) Add/Remove individuals to/from teams
d) Add/Remove individuals/teams to/from projects
e) Add/Retire projects

For a more detailed description of the project, register your group with the 
faculty (one email per group).

#### Statistical Visualization Using R
<hr/>

The Govt. of Ireland releases datasets collected about various aspects of 
society, in the form of OpenData. This project will create a library to download 
multiple datasets (in CSV/JSON format) and visualize the relationships between 
various factors. This visualization must be dynamic, i.e., the user must be able 
to specify factors at runtime. The library should be able to cross-link data 
across datasets (if sensible).

For a more detailed description of the project, register your group with the 
faculty (one email per group).

#### Web-based application for visualizing social network data

There are several social network APIs available that allow a user to visualize 
how they are connected with other people. The project will use (atleast) two 
social networks and visualize the number of cross-connections that users 
have.The project will visualize the following data about a particular user:

a) Correlation between the user and the user's top-20 'friends' frequency of 
posting
b) Correlation between the user and the user's top-20 'friends' time of posting
c) Correlation between the user and the user's top-20 'friends' 'likes' for the 
last year

The project must be able to accept a user-id, and time-period for which the 
analysis needs to be done.


For a more detailed description of the project, please register your group with 
the faculty (one email per group).

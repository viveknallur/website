Teams may want to interact with the client during the mini-project. For this 
purpose, some lecture slots have been converted to client meeting days. The 
following days and times are available for client meetings.  The location for 
these client meetings are the lecture-rooms, that were previously used for that 
weekday's lecture.  10-minute slots will be available for each team, that books 
a slot by emailing the faculty, in advance.

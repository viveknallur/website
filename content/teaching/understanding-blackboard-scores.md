Recall that there are two components to the module evaluation:
<!--more-->

+ Theory (evaluated using an exam) -- 30% of your final mark

+ Practical (evaluated using assignments and a mini-project) -- 70% of your
  final mark

#### Programming Assignment Marks
The individual programming assignments cummulatively account for 35% of your total mark. Hence,
all marks will finally be scaled to 35. Blackboard will show 7 columns for your programming assignments. The columns:

*ProgAssgn-Coding*: Cummulative score from the test-cases, across 4 assignments. Max marks - 20

*ProgAssgn-ZScore*: Cummulative score from the AverageVelocity across 4 assignments. Max marks - 20

*ProgAssgn-PersonalTrend*: Personal Trend score according to the slope of your AverageVelocity. Max marks - 10

*WeightedCodingMark*: Coding accounts for 50% of your programming assignment mark. Max marks - 17.5

*WeightedZScore*: The Z-Score accounts for 25% of your programing assignment mark. Max marks - 8.75

*WeightedPersonalTrend*: The Personal Trend accounts for 25% of your programming assignment mark. Max marks - 8.75

The seventh column shows the aggregate marks (out of 35). The aggregate marks for the programming assignments are a summation of: *WeightedCodingMark*, *WeightedZScore*, *WeightedPersonalTrend*.

#### Scrum-Based Mini-Project

Each project will be graded independently by three graders. Each grader will grade the sprints, as well as the final deliverable, and award a total mark out of 100. The marking table for the  mini-project is as follows:

| Marks | Explanation |
|:------:|:-------------:|
| < 40 | More than one deliverable missing; Committed documents unacceptable/incorrect/low quality |
| 40-50 | Minimally correct, but barely adequate,  more than one deliverable missing |
| 51-70 | Adequate; one/more faults present  or one deliverable missing |
| 71-85 | Fairly good; No major faults; all deliverables present; minor obvious improvements possible |
| 86-100 | Very good; Can expect to manage a project well, given evidence from deliverables |

###### __NOTE: Marks for the project have not yet been uploaded to Blackboard. Marks will be scaled from the total mark to a maximum of 35.__

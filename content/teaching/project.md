The process of the mini-project, to be developed using the scrum methodology, is 
detailed here.

#### Group Selection and Registration
All students must form groups and register their group with the faculty. A group 
can be formed with 4-6 students. Students are free to form groups of their 
choice, with the caveat that one student can only belong to one group 
(obviously!). It is the students' responsibility to ensure that all members of 
the group are willing and able to collaborate with each other, since scrum 
demands a high level of self-organization. 

Things to do after group formation:

1. Select a team-leader. This is the person who will be the contact point 
   between the team and the faculty.
2. The team-leader sends an email to the faculty, registering the group 
   (remember to cc your group members)
3. Select your project, and inform the faculty.

All of the above steps should be *finished* before 14-November-2016

#### Project Selection

There are three projects outlined on the [projects](/teaching/project-list) 
page.  As a group, select one of the projects, according to your language and 
technology preference. 

Project selection should be *finished* before 14-November-2016. Project 
development will start on 14-November-2016, when the client outlines his 
detailed requirements. The faculty will act as the client for the duration of 
the project.

#### Project Development
Project development will be done using the scrum methodology. This entails 
weekly sprint cycles. After the client describes the project requirements, the 
team will create a <u>Product Backlog</u> and a <u>Burn-down Chart</u>. The 
final and weekly deliverables will be given in the detailed project 
requirements. To enable weekly sprint cycles, and meetings with the client, some 
lectures will be converted to meeting time. Teams can request the client for a 
meeting, by booking an [available slot](/teaching/client-meetings).  Code must 
be committed to the team-leader's repository (same as the one being used for the 
assignments), on the 'project' branch, for every weekly sprint cycle.

There will be four sprint cycles:

1. 14-November to 21-November
2. 22-November to 28-November
3. 29-November to 5-December
4. 6-December to 12-December

Sprint deliverables are due the day after the end of the sprint. A list of 
sprint deliverables and their schedule can be found 
[here](/teaching/scrum-schedule).

<br/>
At the end of the second sprint cycle, a _change request_ will be initiated by 
the client. This will modify the *Product Backlog*.
<br/>

The end of the fourth sprint cycle marks the end of the project, and the *Final 
Deliverables* mentioned in the detailed requirements must be committed to the 
team-leader's repository by the end of 13-December, at the latest.

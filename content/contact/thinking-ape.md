Some folks have asked (maybe more have silently wondered) why the landing page features an ape.<!--more--> Especially since, as an academic, the general thrust
of a website is to promote a 'respectable' image of the owner. I suppose, in some weird way, it's a rebellion against the carefully manufactured  image that 
most computer scientists / academics put out into the world (be it of a hacker, thinker, cool-dude, name-your-stereotype). Having an ape be the first impression leads to 
a distortion of what people expect from an academic's site. It lets visitors take me a little less seriously, and reminds me that everything is ephemeral (impressions, papers, philosophies).
It's better to live life, than to think about living it.

Also, in a way, it pays homage to my evolutionary grand-parents. It always pays to know your roots.

Besides, my wife thinks the resemblance is quite striking :)

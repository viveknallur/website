Unfortunately, for some reason, during my academic and professional journey through computer science, 
I've never picked up website design/technologies.<!--more--> While I was in school, HTML 3.x was still
the standard (yes, I'm slightly ancient), javascript was pretty clunky and css was still in its infancy.

While, I've gone on to learn bits of Oz, Lisp, Ruby, Python, R, Julia, I've never gone back to picking up 
web-based technologies. Hence, creating websites is a dark art for me. Thankfully, the advent of static website generators
has come to my rescue, and my site is now more than just one big page like some really old professors' sites! (Fancy css + javascript based one-page sites are staging a come-back, though)

This avatar of my site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Grid-Side](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/grid-side) theme.
Many thanks to the creators of these tools!

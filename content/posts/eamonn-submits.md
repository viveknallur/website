##### Eamonn O'Toole submits his thesis on decentralized emergence detection! <!--more-->

Eamonn has just submitted his thesis entitled "Decentralized Detection of Emergence in Complex Adaptive Systems". Way to go, Eamonn! Very well done! Of course, it's really special to me since he's my first PhD student mentee. It's been a pleasure discussing philosophies, ideas, problems and solution concepts with you, mate. Hope you go far!

The thesis looks at the problem of detecting emergence in a large-scale complex adaptive systems, where each part could potentially be adapting independently. Given the large-scale and decentralized nature of such systems, the big questions are:

* *Is it possible to detect emergence in a decentralized fashion?*
* *How do you know which variables are interesting, given that the environment
and the components themselves, change dynamically?*

For answers to these questions (and more), read his thesis! (We've also submitted a paper to TAAS. Fingers crossed!).

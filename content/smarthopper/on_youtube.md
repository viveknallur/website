##### SmartHopper is now on Youtube!

If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is worth, well, a book-chapter 
at least. Here's [Nicolas Cardozo](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~cardozon/), from our 
group, demonstrating how to use SmartHopper for a whole variety of use-cases. If you don't hear any audio, don't fret. He's the strong and silent type.

I'm very interested in complex self-adaptive systems, engineering emergent 
feedback loops, predicting and controlling emergence in humano-tech systems 
(where technical systems interact heavily with human desires/abilities), 
engineering robust systems from non-robust parts. <!--more--> If you're interested in

### Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are my preferred tool for approaching problems in self-adaptation, complexity, emergence, etc. They lend themselves to extensive
forms of experimentation: having all agents follow simple rules, implementing complex machine-learning algorithms, investigating the interplay of different algorithms
being used at the same time, are all possible with relatively simple conceptual structures. Decoding the end result and teasing out the real factor(s) responsible
for a particular behaviour is considerably more difficult :-). But, that's a part of the fun!

### Decentralized Self-Adaptation
Self-Adaptation as a concept, has been recognized for a long time, from
biological systems to human affairs. Most natural systems exhibit this 
phenomena, viz, the effecting of change by a system to ensure that it continues 
to achieve the utility that it previously did. Different self-adaptive systems 
exhibit adaptivity in different ways. In human-designed systems, the first 
systematic efforts to create a self-adaptive system have been in the domain of 
control loop design. Regardless of the type, most systems can be differentiated on the basis on
where the locus of control for self-adaptation lies:

* **Centralized**: In these type of systems, there is usually a hierarchy of 
  components.
Components at higher levels are responsible for goal management and planning for
change while those at lower levels are responsible for immediate action
and feedback. Decision-making is concentrated in one or a closely related set of 
components. Centralized self-adaptive systems exhibit a communication pattern 
that is
characterized by sensory information (data) flowing from dumb components to the
central decision maker, and instructions (commands) flowing from the decision 
maker
to the dumb components. ‘Dumb’is used here, in the sense of a component having
no awareness of itself and its effects on the environment. Predictable and 
cohesive
response to change are advantages of this type of system. However, reaction 
times get
slower and slower as the size of the system increases.

* **Decentralized**: On the other hand, decentralized systems do not have a 
  hierarchy of
components. Each component acts as an individual agent with its own goals, and its
own perception of the environment. This has the advantage of quick reaction to change.
But it also has the disadvantage of being fragmented. That is, different components
may react differently to the same change stimulus. This could make the self-adaptation
inefficient or even deleterious. The challenge in building a decentralized 
system is to ensure that all the agents collectively move the system towards a common goal. This
is usually accomplished by agents communicating amongst themselves. However, the
lack of a centralized communication pattern means that the communication protocol
must be decentralized and environment-based



##### COIN: Coordination, Organization, Institutions, Norms

These are the particular problems using Multi-Agent Systems, that I'm interested in solving.
	
###### Coordination 

* How do we create coordination mechanisms for (really) large open distributed systems, which have autonomous components? 
  * Guarantee deadlock-freeness, for example 

###### Organization 

* How can we depend on self-organization to meet system goals? 


###### Institutions 
* What structural patterns are most conducive to emergent institutions? 

###### Norms 

* How do we engineer an intelligent socio-technical system such that a self-sustaining/enduring MAS is an emergent property? 
* Can we ensure some form of computational social justice amongst autonomous agents?

** How do we design an intelligent socio-technical system?

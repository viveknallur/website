I'm very interested in complex self-adaptive systems, engineering emergent 
feedback loops, predicting and controlling emergence in humano-tech systems 
(where technical systems interact heavily with human desires/abilities), 
engineering robust systems from non-robust parts. If you're interested in 
collaborating, or just want to chat about a specific topic, [get in

## Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are my preferred tool for approaching problems in self-adaptation, complexity, emergence, etc. They lend themselves to extensive
forms of experimentation: having all agents follow simple rules, implementing complex machine-learning algorithms, investigating the interplay of different algorithms
being used at the same time, are all possible with relatively simple conceptual structures. Decoding the end result and teasing out the real factor(s) responsible
for a particular behaviour is considerably more difficult :-). But, that's a part of the fun!


### COIN: Coordination, Organization, Institutions, Norms

These are the particular problems using Multi-Agent Systems, that I'm interested in solving.
	
#### Coordination 

* How do we create coordination mechanisms for (really) large open distributed systems, which have autonomous components? 
  * Guarantee deadlock-freeness, for example 

#### Organization 

* How can we depend on self-organization to meet system goals? 


#### Institutions 
* What structural patterns are most conducive to emergent institutions? 

#### Norms 

* How do we engineer an intelligent socio-technical system such that a self-sustaining/enduring MAS is an emergent property? 
* Can we ensure some form of computational social justice amongst autonomous agents?

** How do we design an intelligent socio-technical system?
